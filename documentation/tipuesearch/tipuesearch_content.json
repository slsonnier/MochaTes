{"pages":[{"title":"Installing Drupal","text":"Due to the complexity of the features and functionalities of the theme, we recommend you to start with a new fresh Drupal installation. To enable quick and easy setup, TheMAG comes with an installation profile which combines the core Drupal, contributed modules, TheMAG theme, and the pre-defined configurations. Step 1: Copy the entire content from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cthemag_drupal_instalation\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the location on your web server where you want your site to be accessed. Make sure that you have copied all files including the hidden files, especially .htaccess file. Without .htaccess you will face a problem with clean urls. Step 2: Run Drupal Installation. Go to http:\/\/example.com\/install.php. If you installed Drupal in a subfolder, you should point your browser to the subfolder (for example, http:\/\/example.com\/subfolder). Step 3: Choose TheMAG installation profile and click on \u00e2\u0080\u009cSave and Continue\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Step 4: If you see this message during installation process: You need to create a setting.php file. Drupal comes with a default.settings.php file from which you need to make a copy, rename it to settings.php. cp sites\/default\/default.settings.php sites\/default\/settings.php Step 5: Give write permission to setting.php file: chmod 777 sites\/default\/settings.php\u00e2\u0080\u00a8` Step 6: Give Drupal permission to write in sites\/default\/files folder. chmod -R 777 sites\/default\/files\/ Step 7: Refresh the page or click on the &quot;proceed with the installation&quot; link.

This content type is divided into four sections: - Teaser - Content - Categorization - Settings Teaser Section: The Teaser section contains teaser image and summary field. The content of those fields is automatically displayed in the article teaser which is generated by the views module. Content Section: This section is representing the main content of the article. In order to give more editing power, we use the Paragraph module. Instead of putting all the content in one WYSIWYG body field including images and videos, you can choose between predefined paragraph types independent from one another. Currently there are six predefined paragraph types: Image, Video, Embed Video, Gallery Grid, Gallery Slider and Text &amp; HTML. You can edit existing paragraph types or defined new bundles in the Structure &gt; Paragraph Bundles. For more about Paragraphs, see module page: https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/paragraphs Categorization: In this section you can add various meta-information to each post you create. Categories, tags, and post type (post icon). Categories are predefined taxonomies which are used to sort content into different sections. TheMAG comes without predefined categories. So, if you start using TheMAG without demo content, you will need to create some categories before you start creating content. To create category (term), go to: Structure &gt; Taxonomy &gt; Categories and then click on Add term. Settings Section: In this section you can use Post options to include or exclude teaser image from the main content, or to mark post as featured. Also you can use Post layout drop-down menu and choose post layout style for each post you create.","tags":"","url":"Creating_Article.html"},{"title":"Importing Demo Content","text":"The simplest way to start using this theme and to understand its possibilities and functionalities, is to start with the demo content.

Make a copy of the SUBTHEMEKIT folder outside the themag template folder. The location of your sub-theme should be: sites\/all\/themes\/SUBTHEMEKIT. Rename the SUBTHEMEKIT.info.txt file located in the SUBTHEMEKIT folder in SUBTHEMEKIT.info Go to Appearance. Click on Enable and set default on the TheMAG Sub-theme in order to activate it. Build tools TheMAG comes with SCSS files and uses Gulp for its CSS and JavaScript build system, and Bower for package management. To compile SCSS using Gulp: Download and install Node In your terminal navigate to the sites\/all\/themes\/SUBTHEMEKIT directory and run npm install to install the dependencies listed in package.json file. Run gulp to install the components. Run gulp watch.
